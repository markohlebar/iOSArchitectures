Mini case study on different approaches to architecting iOS apps

I started this project to have a stash of ideas and a high level 
overview of how I would approach architecting iOS solutions, 
but I would love to see people making pull requests with better solutions,
or improving on my own. 

Also, if there are any errors in my approach to a certain pattern, 
I would love to hear about that as well.
