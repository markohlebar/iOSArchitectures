iOSArchitectures
================

Mini case study on different approaches to architecting iOS apps

I started this project to have a stash of ideas and a high level 
overview of how I would approach architecting iOS solutions, 
but I would love to see people making pull requests with better solutions,
or improving on my own. 

Also, if there are any errors in my approach to a certain pattern, 
I would love to hear about that as well. 

## MVVM Example ##

Actually this might be considered [MVVMC](http://skimp-blog.blogspot.ie/2012/02/mvvm-is-dead-long-live-mvvmc.html)
example. It is using [BIND](https://github.com/markohlebar/BIND) framework for bindings and some MVVM abstractions. 

### Building ###

To build the MVVM example you should open the `MVVM.workspace` inside the MVVM project and compile.
